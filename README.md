## Site 1
* https://feelingunlucky.today/
* I followed a link from another website promoting it.
* The current design of the website looks a bit dated, looks like it was made early 2010's. The bold colours and the ombre effect from the triangle pattern remind me of a lot of basic designs I saw at the beginning of the decade. Also, the use of many random emojis has that feeling it was made when people didn't know what emojis were really for and people used them any chance they could.
* The navigation system could use some work. most of the links or tabs are easy to understand what they do but some of them I wouldn't know where they would take me without testing it.
* The main part of the site is to show you the last link google would give you for a certain Google search, so for that, you can type anything into the bar and instead of showing the person the top links first, they show you the last links first. There are also links to visit their social media and see their other projects.
* The site isnt very useful but it is interesting to know someone spent some time creating their own version of google that works backwards.
* One thing I would change about this site is their colour scheme, I find that it is way too bright and make the site look way more confusing than it is.

## Site 2
* https://www.spacejam.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm
* I searched for it from a search engine, was a website I remember from a long time ago.
* The design of the website is very outdated since it hasn't been updated since 1996. People were still getting used to the web and with it still being a new concept there was only so much you could do when creating your own site.
* The website is quite simple to navigate through but each button takes you to another list of items which can get confusing if you're looking for something specific on the site.
* Most of the items on the site aren't interactive. Each planet on the main page takes you to another link where there, you can explore deeper and see the music, scrips, and rough work from filming the movie Space Jam. Most of it you just watch clips or read articles, nothing that will get the audience too engaged.
* I feel that the website in its current state is not useful at all. Everything on this site you can find with a simple google search now and this movie is now 23 years old.
* The thing I would change with this site is to update it to be about the second movie that will be coming out in the next year or two.

## Site 3
* https://www.pottermore.com/
* There was an advertisement on a social media site to it.
* The design of this site is very clean and modern. it sticks to the theme from the Harry Potter books with their logos plastered everywhere and the use of colours from the four houses.
* The website is somewhat easy to navigate through. They have a bar at the top of their main page that will take you to other links that have to do about each book series and the quizzes. For some people, this is a hub to get all of the author's updates and new stories so for residents I feel it would feel a lot smoother.
* Some items on this site are interactive, like the quizzes you can take to find out what house you are in or the self-guided tour of the school. This site is mostly for updates on new books and small short stories the author has written.
* I believe that this site is pretty useful. Its where you find everything to do with Harry Potter and all the side stories in the same universe. Don't need to do a google search every time you need to find out something about the story, everything is in one spot.
* The thing I would change about the site is maybe sticking to one layout for all the pages instead of changing it up every new link. It gets quite confusing when flipping through them.

## Site 4
* https://geoguessr.com/
* Was shown to me by my brother.
* The design used on this site is pretty standard. It's just a menu page so it does the job it was made for. The font used for their slogan could be different because for some it might be hard to read.
* The website is extremely easy to navigate through. It is one of the most basic sites to scroll through since it is just a map guessing game. Nothing about it is confusing.
* The whole site is interactive to the viewer since it is a game. The player is placed in a random spot in the world and then they have to guess where on the map they are using google maps.
* I think this site is quite interesting. The premise of the game is quite unique and fun to play. and it's a good place to visit to pass the time.
* One thing I would change to the site is to add other game modes like a timed version or an even more challenging version.

## Site 5
* https://theoatmeal.com/
* Was shown to me by a friend.
* The design of the site is very clean and organized in a disorganized way. The colours draw the eyes down the page to read more articles and comics made by the creator.
* I would say the site is somewhat easy to navigate through. The bar at the top makes it easy to find what you're looking for and each page is organized by newest to oldest.
* The site is not interactive to the audience at all. The whole site is a place for the creator to post new comics or short stories. Nothing on the site can be controlled by the readers.
* I like the website because of the work put on it. I'm a fan of the creator's work and like to be updated about new stories or posts using the site.
* One thing I would add to the site is to change the way the website is laid out. I'd like it to be possible to change the pages to oldest to newest and back to newest to oldest.
